Basic JSP WebService Demo
=========================

The goal of this project is to provide a minimal learning setup to get started on building a web-service that performs a small set of business logic (e.g. in goes some values, out goes some XML formatted answer).
It is a long way from using Eclipse, Maven and Tomcat to building a war-file that you can deploy in Tomcat. This demo-project can be used as a template to get Eclipse, Maven and Tomcat working together so that you can focus on developing code that performs a simple task.

To use this project, you will need the "basicjspws" jar-project installed (see https://github.com/intercommit/basicjspws).
For further installation notes read the ncluded readme-dev.txt and doc/manual.html
