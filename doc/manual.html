<h2>Basic JSP WS</h2>

<div style="font-size:0.8em; float:right">18/6/2012</div>

The goal of this Basic JSP project is to provide a minimal learning setup 
to get started on building a web-service that performs a small set of business logic
(e.g. in goes some values, out goes some XML formatted answer).
<br>It is a long way from using Eclipse, Maven and Tomcat to building a war-file
that you can deploy in Tomcat. The demo-project can be used as a template
to get Eclipse, Maven and Tomcat working together so that you can focus
on developing code that performs a simple task.
<p>
The Basic JSP project does not show how to implement a fully functional web-request handler 
(see also the "Usefulness" chapter at the bottom of this manual).
That depends on the kind of requests you get and the responses that need to be given.
The Basic JSP project does provide functions (e.g. in <code>ControllerUtil</code>) 
that properly handle common cases for basic http-communication. 
</p>

<h3>The setup</h3>

The demo project was build and tested using Java 6, Eclipse Indigo, Tomcat 6 and Maven 2.
If this is not your setup, chances are things will not work together.
<p>
To get started on learning the basics of JSP (and web services) using the Basic JSP WS project,
import the <code>basicjspws</code> and <code>basicjspws-demo</code> projects in Eclipse 
(read the included <code>readme-dev.txt</code> files on how to do this).
Next, get the demo running in Tomcat so that the index-page shows 
(see the included <code>readme-dev.txt</code> file in the demo-project) and click around.
If you use the Tomcat runtime server in Eclipse, do not forget to set the 
<code>logback.configurationFile</code> and <code>basicjspws-demo.home</code> parameters
(see the <code>readme-dev.txt</code> file in the demo-project).
</p>

<h3>The route to serving an index-page</h3>

Stuff starts at <code>/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> in the demo-project.
In here there is a <code>listener-class</code> set that Tomcat will run (set to <code>InitDemo</code>).
In the demo-project <code>InitDemo</code> extends <code>AppInit</code>.
Via <code>InitDemo</code> Tomcat will call <code>AppInit.contextInitialized</code>.
This is where the demo app is initialized. 
<br>Next, Tomcat will call the MainFilter and MainServlet classes that are registered in <code>/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>.
The MainServlet class (<code>nl.intercommit.basicjspws.AppServlet</code>) sets the controllers 
that will handle the requests for a specific URL (<code>AppServlet.registerRequestControllers</code>).
Among other controllers, the <code>Index</code> controller is related to the URL
<code>/basicjspws-demo/</code> and <code>/basicjspws-demo/pages/index</code>.
<br>In other words, if Tomcat receives a http-request to <code>/basicjspws-demo/pages/index</code>
the <code>Index</code> controller is called to handle that request.
The <code>Index</code> controller simply returns the jsp-page that needs to be shown (<code>/WEB-INF/pages/index.jsp</code>).
<p>
Between Tomcat receiving a http-request to <code>/basicjspws-demo/pages/index</code>
and calling the <code>Index</code> controller class, two other classes are involved: <code>AppFilter</code> and <code>AppServlet</code>.
Both are registered in <code>/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> also (which is why Tomcat involves these classes).
<code>AppFilter</code> does a little pre-processing of the http-request 
so that the requested URL is set to <code>/basicjspws-demo/pages/index</code>.
AppServlet looks up the controller that should handle the requested URL.
It then executes this controller by calling <code>Controller.handleRequest</code>.
If this method returns null, <code>AppServlet</code> does nothing. If this method
returns a String, <code>AppServlet</code> assumes this is the jsp-page to display.
In the latter case <code>AppServlet</code> calls a Tomcat function to handle the actual
displaying of the jsp-page (via <code>RequestDispatcher</code>). 
</p>

<h3>Serve my jsp-page</h3>

In <code>/WebContent/WEB-INF/pages</code> copy <code>index.jsp</code> to <code>mypage.jsp</code>.
<br>Create a class <code>MyPage</code>, copy the contents from <code>Index</code> controller
but modify the return-statement to <code>return "/WEB-INF/pages/mypage.jsp"</code>.
<br>Create a class <code>DemoServlet</code> which extends <code>AppServlet</code>.
<br>Override the method <code>registerRequestControllers</code>. In the new method add the following lines:
<pre>
	super.registerRequestControllers(baseUrl);
	requestControllers.put(baseUrl + "pages/mine", new MyPageController());
</pre>
<br>Register the new <code>DemoServlet</code> in <code>/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>
(replace <code>nl.intercommit.basicjspws.AppServlet</code>).
If you have Tomcat running in Eclipse, changes should be applied immediatly.
Navigate to
<br><code>http://localhost:8080/basicjspws-demo/pages/mine</code>
<br>to see your new page.
Alternatively, build the war (<code>mvn package</code>), rename <code>target\basicjspws-demo-1.0.0.war</code>
to <code>basicjspws-demo.war</code> and put it in the <code>TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</code> directory. 
<p>
To integrate your page in the framework, try adding a link to your page in <code>index.jsp</code>
and update <code>mypage.jsp</code> to show something interesting.
If you let <code>mypage.jsp</code> use a session (<code>&lt;%@ page session="true" %&gt;</code>), 
consider using <code>ContollerUtil.getSession</code> in the controller
so that statistics are updated and sessions per host will show on the Statistics page.
</p>

<h4>Rationale for "/pages/"</h4>
There are two reasons for using the "/pages/" pre-fix:
<br> - Maintainability: new pages can be added without changing <code>web.xml</code>. The <code>web.xml</code>
is configured to use <code>AppFilter</code> and <code>AppServlet</code> for anything starting with "/pages/".
<br> - Efficiency: resources like images and css-files should be served directly by Tomcat without
involving any kind of filters or servlets (i.e. additional processing). Using a sub-directory (like "pages") 
is the simplest way to accomplish this.

<h3>Sessions and machine requests</h3>

None of the included jsp-pages uses a session (this is set in the jsp-pages 
in the line <code>&lt;%@ page session="false" %&gt;</code>).
This is because the included pages do not need a session.
If you are developing a web service that interacts with humans mostly,
you will need a session to keep track of who is doing what.
If you are developing a web service for question/answer type of request with other machines,
you should not use sessions (and log warnings when sessions are created) 
since maintaining sessions takes quite some effort.
<p>
When developing a web service for question/answer type of request with other machines,
it helps if there is a page with a form where you can fill in some values
and use those values to perform some kind of query and get an answer. 
In ths case, let the jsp-page activate a session (so that values can be remembered
and you do not need to put the same values in each time), 
but create another controller at another URL that performs the business logic
and does not create a session.
<br>When a "submit" is done on the page, the page-controller can redirect to the controller
at the other URL with the values from the form on the jsp-page. 
In this manner the page-controller can mimic a request from another machine.
</p>
<p>
It is not easy to create a jsp-page with a form and redirect (or post) submit-values to another URL.
But the techniques can be found on the internet and once you have learned this trick,
you can use it to efficiently test the controllers that talk to other machines.
Also, these pages can come in handy as a shotcut for getting particular information.
Last but not least, controllers that talk to other machines (e.g. in goes one parameter,
out goes a XML-formatted answer) and do not use a session are very efficient:
they can serve millions of requests without giving Tomcat any kind of stress. 
</p> 

<h3>Logging</h3>

Logging is only important when debugging and when you are in trouble,
which is why it needs to be done properly from the start. 
<code>LogbackUtil</code> shows what is needed to get it done properly.
Note for example that you cannot rely on default log-configuration files (e.g. <code>logback.xml</code>)
because that could mean that all web-services running on Tomcat write to the same log-file
(which makes examining the log for one particular problem nearly impossible).
It is possible to make one log-configuration file for all web-services running on a Tomcat instance
(simply use different appenders for different classes), but that must be a conscious decision
to create and maintain such a log-configuration file for all web-services.
<br>The log-configuration file provided with the demo project (<code>basicjspws-demo-logback.xml</code>)
shows which log-options and associated features you need to do any proper logging.
Note for example the reload&amp;reconfigure option (<code>scanPeriod</code>): essential when you need 
debug-log statements without making the web-sevice unavailable. 
<br>One thing missing from this demo-project is the use of MDC during logging.
The use of MDC makes it easy to relate log-statements to one particular http-request
without the need to modify your code for log-statements. See for more information
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html">Logback MDC</a>.
<br>Another logging technique is to cache all debug log-statements for a http-request and
only write these debug log-statements to file when an error occurs. 
Logback provides sufficient support for this use-case 
(see also <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#SiftingAppender">Logback SiftingAppender</a>).

<h3>Usefulness of the Basic JSP framework</h3>

The Basic JSP project was developed after creating three web-services which mostly serve
machine requests. The framework, in particular the use of the Controller concept,
has proven to be efficient and stable (over 10 million requests served without issues).
For internal "tools" projects, jsp-pages can be used to 
efficiently develop web-pages that come in very handy at times
(especially when working with legacy systems that require the controller to
perform tasks in a "almost but not quite standard manner").
The framework has not been used (and should not be used) to
guide human interaction through various complex web-pages.
Other tools and frameworks have been developed for this use-case.
With those other frameworks you will rarely need to work on a low http-communication level, 
but understanding the building bricks of low-level http-communicationd does provide insight
in how these frameworks function and where to look in case of trouble.
The Controller idea included in the Basic JSP Demo project allows you to
experiment freely with low-level http-communication.
